= Client Settings Using the Python SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Client Settings

The Python SDK may be configured using the connection string when instantiating a [.api]`Bucket` object.

In addition to the connection string, the [.api]`Bucket` object offers a few object attributes which can be used to configure settings during runtime:

* `timeout` for key-value operation timeouts (equivalent to `operation_timeout` in the connection string)
* `views_timeout` to adjust the timeout for MapReduce queries
* `n1ql_timeout` to adjust the timeout for N1QL querties

Below follows the C settings section:
