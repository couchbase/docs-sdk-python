= Compatibility

== Couchbase Version/SDK Version Matrix

Couchbase SDKs are tested against a variety of different environments to ensure both backward and forward compatibility with different versions of Couchbase Server.
The matrix below denotes the version of Couchbase Server, the version of the Python SDK and whether the SDK is:

* ✖ *Unsupported*: This combination is not tested, and is not within the scope of technical support if you have purchased a support agreement.
* ◎ *Compatible*: This combination has been tested previously, and should be compatible.
This combination is not supported or recommended by our technical support organization.
It is best to upgrade either the SDK or the Couchbase version you are using.
* ✔ *Supported*:This combination is subject to ongoing quality assurance, and is fully supported by our technical support organization.

== Feature Compatibility

To take advantage of all features offered by Couchbase Server, you need to know what version of the client provides compatibility for the features you want to use.
The following matrix shows which versions of the Python client support the major features of each version of Couchbase Server.

Note that some of the features are dependent on the underlying C library (_libcouchbase_).

IMPORTANT: With xref:sdk-authentication-overview.adoc[RBAC], in Couchbase Server 5.0, authentication will depend upon access privileges, and upgrading to 5.0 with existing buckets, or upgrading Server, will require taking these changes into account.
