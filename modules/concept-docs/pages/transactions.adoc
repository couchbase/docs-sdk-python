== Overview

== Rollback

If an exception is thrown, either by the application from the lambda, or by the transaction internally, then that attempt is rolled back.
The transaction logic may or may not be retried, depending on the exception.

If the transaction is not retried then it will throw an exception, and its `message` property can be used to inspect the details of the failure.

The application can use this to signal why it triggered a rollback, as so:

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$transactions_example.py[tag=rollback_cause,indent=0]
----

After a transaction is rolled back, it cannot be committed, no further operations are allowed on it, and the system will not try to automatically commit it at the end of the code block.
