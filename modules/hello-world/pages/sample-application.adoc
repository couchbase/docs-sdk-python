== Sample App Backend

The backend code shows Couchbase Python SDK in action with Query and Search,
but also how to plug together all of the elements and build an application with Couchbase Server and the Python SDK.

Here's the airport search code, which checks to see whether the search term for the query string is a three or four letter FAA or ICAO abbreviation,
and if not searches for it as an airport name:

[source,python]
----
def findall(self):
    """Returns list of matching airports and the source query"""
    querystr = request.args['search']
    queryprep = "SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE "
    sameCase = querystr == querystr.lower() or querystr == querystr.upper()
    if sameCase and len(querystr) == 3:
        queryprep += "faa=$1"
        queryargs = [querystr.upper()]
    elif sameCase and len(querystr) == 4:
        queryprep += "icao=$1"
        queryargs = [querystr.upper()]
    else:
        queryprep += "POSITION(LOWER(airportname), $1) = 0"
        queryargs = [querystr.lower()]

    res = cluster.query(queryprep, *queryargs)
    airportslist = [x for x in res]
    context = [queryprep]
    response = make_response(
        jsonify({"data": airportslist, "context": context}))
    return response
