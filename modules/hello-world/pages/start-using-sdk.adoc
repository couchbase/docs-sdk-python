[abstract]
The Couchbase Python SDK allows Python applications to access a Couchbase cluster.
The Python SDK offers a traditional synchronous API as well as integration with _twisted_, _gevent_, and _asyncio_.
It depends on the C SDK, _libcouchbase_, (included automatically) which it uses for performance and reliability.

// tag::prep[]

The Couchbase Python SDK 3.0 is a complete rewrite of the API, reducing the number of overloads to present a simplified surface area, and adding support for future Couchbase Server features like Collections and Scopes (available in Couchbase Server 6.5 as a xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[developer preview]).

The 3.0 Python SDK introduces comprehensive https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/[PEP-484] style type annotations.


== Requirements

The Python SDK 3.0 requires Python 3, with Python 3.5 and above supported.

Couchbase Python SDK bundles libcouchbase automatically, so no need to install it separately.

You may need cmake to install, although the installer will attempt to download it from PyPI automatically.

NOTE: Currently the Python Client requires the OpenSSL headers and libraries that the Python client itself was built against to be installed prior to the client itself. 
Better packaging for OpenSSL support is currently being developed.

== Installing on Linux

.Debian and Ubuntu
[source,bash]
----
# Only needed during first-time setup:
sudo apt install git-all python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools cmake build-essential

# for TLS/SSL support (optional)
sudo apt install libssl-dev

sudo pip3 install couchbase

----

.RHEL and CentOS
[source,bash]
----
# Only needed during first-time setup:
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ python3-devel python3-pip cmake

# for TLS/SSL support (optional)
sudo dnf install openssl-devel

sudo pip3 install couchbase
----

NOTE: RHEL/CentOS distributions may not provide the `python-pip` package in the base repositories.
It may be found in the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL[EPEL^] repository.

NOTE: Cmake may also need to be updated.  IF so, follow the steps https://idroot.us/install-cmake-centos-8[HERE^].

== Installation on Mac OS X

The following example uses the Python supplied by the Homebrew package manager and not the vendor-supplied Python which ships with OS X.  

To install the library on Mac OS X, first install Homebrew: http://brew.sh/[Homebrew^]. Once _Homebrew_ is configured:

NOTE: Later versions of Mac OS X break the python3 homebrew installer.  Simple mitigating steps may be found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47255517/brew-install-python3-didnt-install-pip3[HERE^].


[source,bash]
----
brew update # get list of latest packages
brew install python3
brew install openssl # for TLS/SSL support - optional

pip3 install couchbase
----



== Installing on Microsoft Windows

[source,shell]
----
pip install couchbase
----

NOTE: Because the Windows client is packaged as binary wheel,
it currently is compiled without OpenSSL support, to allow it to be run without OpenSSL.
We are working on providing OpenSSL support for Windows shortly -- 
it is possible to build and run against an OpenSSL compiled for Windows manually given the correct version of the OpenSSL headers and libraries are visible to the compiler, 
and the OpenSSL dynamic libraries are in the PATH at runtime.

// end::install[]


== Hello Couchbase

The code snippet below shows how the Python SDK may be used for some common operations.

[source,python]
----
include::../examples/hello_world_t.py[tag=intro]
----

=== Connecting

To connect to a Couchbase bucket, you must use Couchbase _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC).
This is fully described in the section xref:6.5@server:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Authorization].
An _authenticator_, containing username and password, should be defined, and then passed to the cluster.
Following successful authentication, the bucket can be opened:

[source,python]
----
include::../examples/hello_world_t.py[tag=connecting]
----

Once defined, the authenticator can be passed to other clusters, as appropriate.

See xref:howtos:managing-connections.adoc[Managing Connections] for more connection options and details about the connection string.

=== Document Operations

xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[Document operations], such as storing and retrieving documents, can be done using simple methods on the `Bucket` class such as `Bucket.get` and `Bucket.upsert`.
Simply pass the key (and value, if applicable) to the relevant methods.

[source,python]
----
include::../examples/hello_world_t.py[tag=docopsget]
----

[source,python]
----
include::../examples/hello_world_t.py[tag=docopsupsert]
----

=== N1QL Queries

Couchbase N1QL queries are performed by running the `Cluster.query` method.

== Additional Resources

The API reference is generated for each release and the latest can be found http://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-python-client/[here].

Older API references are linked from their respective sections in the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Individual Release Notes].
Most of the API documentation can also be accessed via `pydoc`.

xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc[The Migrating from SDK2 to 3 page] highlights the main differences to be aware of when migrating your code.

Couchbase welcomes community contributions to the Python SDK.
The Python SDK source code is available on link:https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client[GitHub].


=== PyPy support

Because the Python SDK is written primarily in C using the CPython API, the official SDK will not work on PyPy.

Please link:https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/PYCBC/issues[create a Jira ticket] if you require a PyPy-compatible version of the SDK.
