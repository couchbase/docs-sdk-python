This example uses https://pypi.org/project/Flask/[Flask] as a web-framework for a Python REST API.
Flask has no direct support for async, but another code sample is available demonstrating this whole application using the Couchbase async API https://github.com/couchbase/docs-sdk-python/blob/release/3.1/modules/howtos/examples/caching_fastapi.py[here].
You can also find the https://github.com/couchbase/docs-sdk-python/blob/release/3.1/modules/howtos/examples/caching_flask.py[full code for _this_ example here].


== Basic Endpoint

Our first basic endpoints will be a get and set call, using HTTP methods `GET` and `POST` and Couchbase methods `get` and `insert` respectively:

.GET
[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$caching_flask.py[tag=get]
----

.POST
[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$caching_flask.py[tag=post]
----

This is the simplest API we can make -- allowing us to set and get arbitrary JSON from any key we specify.
We also include the `expiry` parameter, which will automatically delete the document (invalidate the cache) after a set amount of time.


== Cache Miss

There are many ways this can and could be improved upon for real world use.
What happens in the case of a cache miss?
With this code, we handle the `DocumentNotFoundException` and respond with a HTTP 404.

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$caching_flask.py[tag=get]
----

== Error Handling

We can also improve the POST function to deal with some of the errors it may encounter.
Even if something unexpected happens, we can still be helpful by including the error in the 500 response, and by catching any `CouchbaseException` as a fallback:

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$caching_flask.py[tag=post]
----

The last thing we'll do is add `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints, matching up to the Couchbase operations `upsert` and `remove`, and apply the same error handling once more:

.PUT
[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$caching_flask.py[tag=put]
----

.DELETE
[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$caching_flask.py[tag=delete]
----
