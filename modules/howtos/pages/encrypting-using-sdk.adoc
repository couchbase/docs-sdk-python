[#package]
== Packaging

The Couchbase Python SDK works together with the https://github.com/couchbase/python-couchbase-encryption[Python Couchbase Encryption^] library to provide support for encryption and decryption of JSON fields.
This library makes use of the cryptographic algorithms available on your platform, and provides a framework for implementing your own crypto components.

NOTE: The encryption code is packaged as an optional library and is subject to the Couchbase https://www.couchbase.com/LA03012021[License] and https://www.couchbase.com/ESLA08042020[Enterprise Subscription License] agreements.
To use the encryption library, you have to explicitly include this dependency in your project configuration.
Refer to the xref:#pip-install[install section].

[#requirements]
== Requirements
* Couchbase Python SDK version `3.2.0` or later.
* Python Couchbase Encryption version `1.0.0` or later.

[#pip-install]
== Install

[source,bash]
----
$ python3 -m pip install cbencryption
----

See the https://github.com/couchbase/python-couchbase-encryption/tags[GitHub repository tags^] for the latest version.

== Configuration

The Python Field-Level Encryption library works on the principle of `Encrypters` and `Decrypters` which can be packaged within a `Provider`. `Encrypters` and `Decrypters` are registered with a `CryptoManager` and are then used to encrypt and decrypt specified fields.

Here weâ€™ll go through an example of setting up and using the Python Field-Level Encryption library.

To begin we need to create a couple of keys, you should *not* use the `InsecureKeyring` other than for evaluation purposes and should keep your keys secure.

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$encrypting_using_sdk.py[tag=keys]
----

Now that we have keys we can create a `Provider` (here we use the `AeadAes256CbcHmacSha512` algorithm which is the default supplied by the library).
The `Provider` gives us a way to easily create multiple encrypters for the same algorithm but different keys.
At this point we also create `CryptoManager` and register our encrypters and decrypters with it.

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$encrypting_using_sdk.py[tag=provider]
----

== Usage

Once an `CryptoManager` has registered encrypters and decrypters, encryption/decryption of specified fields can be handled with helper methods.  For example, the methods below take a `CryptoManager`, the document that should have specified fields encrypted/decrypted and a list of field specs specifing the needed information in order to encrypt/decrypt fields in the document.

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$encrypting_using_sdk.py[tag=helper_methods]
----

Next, create a document and a list of field specs specifying which fields in the document should be encrypted.  Then, save the encrypted document returned by the encryption helper method to Couchbase.

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$encrypting_using_sdk.py[tag=save_to_couchbase]
----

Retrieving the document from couchbase and displaying the document, as seen below, should output something like the following.

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$encrypting_using_sdk.py[tag=output_encrypted_doc]
----

[source, json]
----
{
    "firstName": "Monty",
    "lastName": "Python",
    "encrypted$password":
    {
        "alg": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA512",
        "kid": "secret_key",
        "ciphertext": "QnXBcTA3P1p5WFfH+2kJbrKy2iSKCwxZZgbnJzrxy1dnh2TLloBxwJZ13UFZZmtGZf2F3whTnoj/60Q9zOQvbA=="
    },
    "encrypted$address":
    {
        "alg": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA512",
        "kid": "secret_key1",
        "ciphertext": "bt6fGSwf7buX49+ddHlVnJjLkauVRgSSF4/VdEdOlIZ7xHwtVXsQCFpvz7XqEhzQho57m5YJQWR/oC1kjQlZZMFyPaXGhS4Mku7K1x2duZucjSDxmch4fkdcm6SZsb/UE9bfLCf2F9g8oKJzrkyjlFhR4+3h8H4JtxuOn/3xpyQLoVTbHTWgO0WMDHULdLb1"
    },
    "encrypted$phone":
    {
        "alg": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA512",
        "kid": "secret_key",
        "ciphertext": "723JCAusPFm1kaWLnOkZRjNBFMM9mCORwPntk4s/4RIOCmv0DJ4gTwEiUy8XNewvUa44MzkMG7IW5SyWB4qFZw=="
    }
}
----

Passing the document with encrypted fields to the decryption helper, as in the example below, should provide the decrypted document and the output should look something like the following.

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$encrypting_using_sdk.py[tag=decrypt_doc]
----

[source,json]
----
{
    "firstName": "Monty",
    "lastName": "Python",
    "password": "bang!",
    "address":
    {
        "street": "999 Street St.",
        "city": "Some City",
        "state": "ST",
        "zip": "12345"
    },
    "phone": "123456"
}

[#migration-from-sdk2]
== Migrating from SDK 2

WARNING: SDK 2 cannot read fields encrypted by SDK 3.

It's inadvisable to have both the old and new versions of your application active at the same time.
The simplest way to migrate is to do an offline upgrade during a scheduled maintenance window.
For an online upgrade without downtime, consider a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment[blue-green deployment^].

SDK 3 requires additional configuration to read fields encrypted by SDK 2.
The rest of this section describes how to configure Field-Level Encryption in SDK 3 for backwards compatibility with SDK 2.

[#configure-field-name-prefix]
=== Changing the field name prefix

In SDK 2, the default prefix for encrypted field names was `\__crypt_`.
This caused problems for Couchbase Sync Gateway, which does not like field names to begin with an underscore.
In SDK 3, the default prefix is `encrypted$`.

For compatibility with SDK 2, you can configure the `CryptoManager` to use the old `\__crypt_` prefix:

[source,python]
----
prefix = "__crpyt_"
mgr = DefaultCryptoManager(encrypted_field_prefix=prefix)
----

Alternatively, you can https://forums.couchbase.com/t/replacing-field-name-prefix/28786[rename the existing fields using a {sqlpp} (formerly N1QL) statement].

WARNING: In SDK 2, only top-level fields could be encrypted.
SDK 3 allows encrypting fields at any depth.
If you decide to rename the existing fields, make sure to do so _before_ writing any encrypted fields below the top level, otherwise it may be difficult to rename the nested fields using a generic {sqlpp} statement.


[#configure-legacy-decrypters]
=== Enabling decrypters for legacy algorithms

The encryption algorithms used by SDK 2 are deprecated, and are no longer used for encrypting new data.
To enable decrypting fields written by SDK 3, register the legacy decrypters with the `CryptoManager`:

include::howtos:example$encrypting_using_sdk.py[tag=legacy_support]
