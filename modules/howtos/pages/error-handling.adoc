Couchbase gives you a lot of flexibility, but it is recommended that you equip yourself with an understanding of the possibilities.

== How the SDK Handles Exceptions

Couchbase-specific exceptions are all derived from `CouchbaseException`.
Errors that cannot be recovered by the SDK will be returned to the application.
These unrecoverable errors are left to the application developer to handle -- this section covers handling many of the common error scenarios.

== Handling Exceptions

The Python SDK works directly with the built in exception handling available in Python. This enables you to catch, interrogate, and handle or log them and continue. Depending on the type of the exception you catch, there are a number of properties which will be available to you. Couchbase-specific exceptions are all derived from `CouchbaseException`.

How you handle exceptions in your application will depend upon the type of exception thrown.
Is it transient?
Is it even recoverable?
Below we examine error handling strategies in relation to the Couchbase SDKs, then take a practical walk through some common error scenarios you are likely to have to handle when working with a Couchbase cluster.

=== Failing
While most of the time you want more sophisticated exception handling strategies, sometimes you just need to fail.
It makes no sense for some exceptions to be retried, either because they are not transient, or because you already tried everything to make it work and it still keeps failing.
If containment is not able to handle the exception, then it needs to propagate up to a parent component that can handle it.

For synchronous programs, every error is converted into an Exception and thrown so that you can use regular `try`/`except` semantics.

If you do not catch the Exception, it will bubble up:

=== Logging

It is always important to log errors, but even more so in the case of reactive applications. Because of the event driven nature, stack traces get harder to look at, and caller context is sometimes lost.

=== Retry

Transient errors -- such as those caused by resource starvation -- are best tackled with one of the following retry strategies:

Retry immediately.
Retry with a fixed delay.
Retry with a linearly increasing delay.
Retry with an exponentially increasing delay.
Retry with a random delay.

Consider a decorator that provides flexibility to determine which Exceptions to retry and how to retry (fixed, linear or exponential delay).

== Key-Value Exceptions

The KV Service exposes several common errors that can be encountered - both during development, and to be handled by the production app. Here we will cover some of the most common errors.


If a particular key cannot be found a `DocumentNotFoundException` is raised:

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$error_handling.py[tag=DocumentNotFoundException]
----

On the other hand if the key already exists and should not (e.g. on an insert) then a `DocumentExistsException` is raised:

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$error_handling.py[tag=DocumentExistsException]
----

=== CAS Mismatch

Couchbase provides optimistic concurrency using CAS.
Each document gets a CAS value on the server, which is changed on each mutation.
When you get a document you automatically receive its CAS value, and when replacing the document, if you provide that CAS the server can check that the document has not been concurrently modified by another agent in-between.
If it has, it returns `CASMismatchException`. See the xref:#retry[Retry] section for an approach to retry in this scenario.

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$error_handling.py[tag=CASMismatchException]
----

=== Ambiguity

There are situations with any distributed system in which it is simply impossible to know for sure if the operation completed successfully or not.
Take this as an example: your application requests that a new document be created on Couchbase Server.
This completes, but, just before the server can notify the client that it was successful, a network switch dies and the application's connection to the server is lost.
The client will timeout waiting for a response and will raise a `TimeoutException`, but it's ambiguous to the app whether the operation succeeded or not.

Another ambiguous exception is `DurabilitySyncWriteAmbiguousException`, which can returned when performing a durable operation.
This also indicates that the operation may or may not have succeeded: though when using durability you are guaranteed that the operation will either have been applied to all replicas, or none.

.Given the inevitability of ambiguity, how is the application supposed to handle this?

This needs to be considered case-by-case, but the general strategy is to become certain if the operation succeeded or not, and to retry it if required.

For instance, consider inserts:
on an ambiguous Exception, you can simply *retry* the insert.
If it now fails with a `DocumentExistsException`, we know that the previous operation was in fact successful:

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$error_handling.py[tag=DurabilitySyncWriteAmbiguousException]
----

=== Non-Idempotent Operations

An "Idempotent operation" is one that can be applied multiple times yet still have the same effect, exactly once.

* Repeatedly setting an email field is Idempotent. (If you do it twice, the email field will have the same, expected value.)
* Increasing a counter by one is Non-Idempotent. (If you do it twice, the result will now have increased by *2*.)

We can view some operations as idempotent because they will fail with no effect after the first success.
This was the case for inserts, as we saw above.

Idempotent operations are much easier to handle, as on ambiguous error results (`DurabilitySyncWriteAmbiguousException` and `TimeoutException`) the operation can simply be retried.

Most key-value operations are idempotent.
Non-Idempotent operations include a Sub-Document arrayAppend call, or a counter increment.
After an ambiguous exception on a Non-Idempotent operation, you should first read the document to check for yourself whether or not that change was applied.

== Query and Analytics Errors

A {sqlpp} (formerly N1QL) query either returns results or will throw an error with a `QueryErrorContext`, like so:

[source,python]
----
include::howtos:example$error_handling.py[tag=QueryErrorContext]
----

Analytics works in an identical fashion, potentially raising an analytics specific error and having an `AnalyticsErrorContext`.

== Additional Resources
Errors & Exception handling is an expansive topic.
Here, we have covered examples of the kinds of exception scenarios that you are most likely to face.
More fundamentally, you also need to weigh up xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc[concepts of durability].

Diagnostic methods are available to check on the xref:health-check.adoc[health if the cluster], and the xref:tracing-from-the-sdk.adoc[health of the network].

Logging methods are dependent upon the platform and SDK used.
We offer xref:collecting-information-and-logging.adoc[recommendations and practical examples].

// We have a xref:ref:error-codes.adoc[listing of error messages], with some pointers to what to do when you encounter them.
