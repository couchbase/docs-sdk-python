{description}

The Python SDK 3.x requires Python 3, with Python 3.5 and above supported.
Because the Python SDK is written primarily in C using the CPython API, the official SDK will not work on PyPy.

Please let us know if you require a PyPy-compatible version of the SDK.


== Couchbase Version/SDK Version Matrix

Couchbase SDKs are tested against a variety of different environments to ensure both backward and forward compatibility with different versions of Couchbase Server.
The matrix below denotes the version of Couchbase Server, the version of the Python SDK and whether the SDK is:

* ✖ *Unsupported*: This combination is not tested, and is not within the scope of technical support if you have purchased a support agreement.
* ◎ *Compatible*: This combination has been tested previously, and should be compatible.
This combination is not recommended by our technical support organization.
It is best to upgrade either the SDK or the Couchbase version you are using.
* ✔ *Supported*: This combination is subject to ongoing quality assurance, and is fully supported by our technical support organization.

See the notes there for Support details.


=== Capella Compatibility

At time of release, the Couchbase 3.2 Python SDK is fully compatible with Couchbase Capella, our fully-hosted database-as-a-service.

== Python Version Compatibility

The Python SDK is tested with Python versions 3.5 - 3.9.
Other Python versions and implementations might work but are _not tested and are not supported_.
We recommend using a Python version, with the highest patch version available, that is not close to reaching end of life according to the Python Software Foundation.

CAUTION: The Couchbase Python SDK will drop support for https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478/#release-schedule[Python 3.5] and https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/#lifespan[Python 3.6] with the 3.3.0 release, tentatively March 2022.

The following Python versions are supported:

* https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478/#release-schedule[Python 3.5]
* https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/#lifespan[Python 3.6]
* https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/#lifespan[Python 3.7]
* https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0569/#lifespan[Python 3.8]
* https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0596/#lifespan[Python 3.9]

Please make sure you run on one of the latest patch releases, since they provide stability improvements and security fixes in general.

== Platform Compatibility

The Python SDK is built on top of libcouchbase (the C SDK), which is tested and supported on the following platforms:

****
[discrete]
=== GNU/Linux

* Amazon Linux 2.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 & 8;
+
& CentOS 7 & 8.
* Ubuntu (LTS) 16.04 (_Xenial_), 18.04 (_Bionic_), & 20.04 (_Focal_).
* Debian 9 (_Stretch_) & 10 (_Buster_).
* Alpine Linux (since Python SDK 3.2.7).

[discrete]
=== Microsoft Windows

Microsoft Windows 7 / Windows Server 2012 and onwards.

[discrete]
=== Mac OS X

The current and previous two releases of OS X.
At time of writing (July 2021): 10.14 (_Mojave_), 10.15 (_Catalina_), and 11 (_Big Sur_).

Although installable or compilable on many other platforms, we cannot provide support for untested combinations.
