= Migrating to SDK 3 API
:description: The SDK API 3 (used in Python SDK 3.x and 4.x) introduces breaking changes to the previous SDK API 2 APIs (used in Python SDK 2.x) in order to provide a number of improvements. \
Collections and Scopes are introduced.

[abstract]
{description}
The Document class and structure has been completely removed from the API, and the returned value is now `Result`.
Retry behaviour is more proactive, and lazy bootstrapping moves all error handling to a single place.
Individual behaviour changes across services are explained here.

The current Python SDK 4.0 is also based on the xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#sdk3.3[SDK API 3.3 specification], and offers an entirely new backend (Couchbase++) with better support for new features like Distributed ACID Transactions.
We have increased the major version to reflect the importance of this implementation change as per https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

Couchbase Python SDK 4.0, like the 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 versions, conforms to the Couchbase 3.x SDK API.
Couchbase Python SDK 4.0 is built upon Couchbase++, whereas 3.x releases were built upon LCB (libcouchbase)

NOTE: For the most part, migration from SDK API 2._x_ versions remains the same.
The few 4.0-specific changes can be found at the end of this document.
If you are an existing Python SDK 3._x_ user considering migrating to SDK 4.0,
you may wish to skip to the <<sdk4-specifics,SDK 4.0 specifics>> below.

As an example here is a KeyValue document fetch:

[source,python]
----
from datetime import timedelta
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
from couchbase.collection import GetOptions
cluster=Cluster("couchbases://10.192.1.104")
collection=cluster.default_collection()
get_result = collection.get("key", GetOptions(timeout=timedelta(seconds=3)))
----

Compare this to a {sqlpp} (formerly N1QL) query:

// change to $Your_language
[source,python]
----
query_result = cluster.query("select 1=1", QueryOptions(timeout=timedelta(seconds=3)))
----

// Outline below for individual SDKs -- please expand as appropriate, many topics can be covered lightly
//
// Please use before(2.n) / after (3.0) snippets in all cases where it is helpful
// (probably nearly everywhere, I'm afraid)


===  Installation and Configuration

The primary source of artifacts is xref:installation.adoc[the installation page], 
where we publish links to pre-built binaries, as well as to source tarballs.
Builds can be found on PyPi.
Please see the xref:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes] for up-to-date information.

////
//  - discuss new dependencies if needed
//  - discuss configuration old and new, especially if certain
//    custom options are not present anymore (why they are not used)
//    and how users might want to transfer this config over to the
//    new one
//  - discuss cert auth
//  - discuss encryption config
////

IMPORTANT: Python SDK 3.x and 4.x have a minimum required Python version of 3.5, although we recommend running the latest fully supported version (i.e. at the time of writing Python 3.10) with the highest patch version available.

Note that the transitive dependency list has changed.
As a refresher, Python SDK API 2 depended on the following packages:

* **typing**

SDK API 3 depends on the following ones instead:

* **typing** (on Python<3.7)
* **typing-extensions** (on Python<3.8)
* **boltons**
* **pyrsistent**

Additionally these are supported optionally in SDK API 2 and SDK API 3.

* **Twisted**
* **gevent**

TIP: If you are pulling in the SDK through a package manager (recommended), all mandatory dependencies will be resolved for you automatically.


=== Configuring Collections

The fundamental semantics of the `Bucket` from SDK API 2 are analogous to that of the `Collection` in SDK API 3.

[source,python]
----
# SDK API 2 custom KV timeout
bucket = Bucket("couchbases://127.0.0.1/default")
bucket.timeout=5
----

[source,python]

----
include::example$migrating.py[tag=timeoutbuilder,indent=0]
----

The default settings can still be customized through either the connection string or xref:ref:client-settings.adoc[system properties].
The SDK has elaborate reflection logic in place to parse "flat" string values and apply them to the builder, which means that you can now configure more properties than in SDK API 2.
Note that the property paths have changed.

////
// [source,python]
// ----
// include::example$migrating.py[tag=sysprops,indent=0]
// ----
////

[source,python]
----
include::example$migrating.py[tag=connstr,indent=0]
----
See the xref:ref:client-settings.adoc[configuration section] for full specifics.

At the end of this guide you'll find a xref:#configurations-options-reference[reference] that describes the SDK API 2 environment options and their SDK 3 equivalents where applicable.


=== Authentication

Since SDK API 2 supports Couchbase Server clusters older than 5.0, it had to support both Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as well as bucket-level passwords.
The minimum cluster version supported by SDK API 3 is Server 5.0, which means that only RBAC is supported.
This is why you can set the username and password when directly connecting:

[source,python]
----
include::example$migrating.py[tag=rbac,indent=0]
----

This is just a shorthand for:

[source,python]
----
include::example$migrating.py[tag=rbac-full,indent=0]
----

The reason why you can pass in a specific authenticator is that you can also use the same approach to configure certificate-based authentication:


[source,python]
----
include::example$migrating.py[tag=certauth,indent=0]
----

// Please see the xref:howtos:authentication.adoc[documentation on certificate-based authentication] for detailed information on how to configure this properly.


== Connection Lifecycle

// - discuss bootstrapping
//- important: bootstrapping is now "lazy" so also discuss how to do the eager
// checks and any impact it might have on the first op being slow?

From a high-level perspective, bootstrapping and shutdown is very similar to SDK API 2.

////
// One notable difference is that the `Collection` is introduced and that the individual methods like `bucket` immediately return, and do not throw an exception.
// Compare SDK API 2: the `openBucket` method would not work if it could not open the bucket.

// The reason behind this change is that even if a bucket can be opened, a millisecond later it may not be available any more.
// All this state has been moved into the actual operation so there is only a single place where the error handling needs to take place.
// This simplifies error handling and retry logic for an application.

// - discuss shutdown
// - if external state is passed in optionally, discuss
// management of this state
// - discuss the impact of 6.5 "gcccp" and cluster level queries
// - SASL by default on non-PLAIN (if applicable)

// In SDK API 2, you connected, opened a bucket and performed a KV op like this:

// [source,python]
// ----
// from couchbase_v2.cluster import Cluster as SDK2Cluster, PasswordAuthenticator
// cluster = SDK2Cluster("127.0.0.1")
// cluster.authenticate(PasswordAuthenticator("user", "pass"))
// bucket = cluster.open_bucket("travel-sample")

// get_result = bucket.get("airline_10")
// ----

// Here is the SDK API 3 equivalent:

// [source,python]
// ----
// include::example$migrating.py[tag=simpleget,indent=0]
// ----
////

`Collections` will be generally available with an upcoming Couchbase Server release, but the SDK already encodes it in its API to be future-proof.
If you are using a Couchbase Server version which does not support `Collections`, always use the `default_collection()` method to access the KV API; it will map to the full bucket.

////
// IMPORTANT: You'll notice that `bucket(str)` returns immediately, even if the bucket resources are not completely opened.
// This means that the subsequent `get` operation may be dispatched even before the socket is open in the background.
// The SDK will handle this case transparently, and reschedule the operation until the bucket is opened properly.
// This also means that if a bucket could not be opened (say, because no server was reachable) the operation will time out.
// Please check the logs to see the cause of the timeout (in this case, you'll see socket connect rejections).
////

Also note, you will now find Query, Search, and Analytics at the `Cluster` level.
This is where they logically belong.
If you are using Couchbase Server 6.5 or later, you will be able to perform cluster-level queries even if no bucket is open.
If you are using an earlier version of the cluster you must open at least one bucket, otherwise cluster-level queries will fail.

////
// === Serialization and Transcoding

//  - describe how it works for your language, how to override and any platform-specific
//    encoding and decoding guidelines.
//  - Also important how to convert from the document types to the new approach

// In SDK 2 the main method to control transcoding was through providing different `Document` instances (which in turn had their own transcoder associated), such as the `JsonDocument`.
// This only worked for the KV APIs though -- Query, Search, Views, and other services exposed their JSON rows/hits in different ways.
// All of this has been unified in SDK 3 under a single concept: serializers and transcoders.

// By default, all KV APIs transcode to and from JSON -- you can also provide Python Transcodable objects which you couldn't in the past.

// [source,python]
// ----
// include::example$migrating.py[tag=upsertandget_sdk2,indent=0]
// ----

// [source,python]
// ----
// include::example$migrating.py[tag=upsertandget,indent=0]
// ----

// //[source,python]
// //----
// //include::example$migrating.py[tag=rawjson,indent=0]
// //----


// Serializers and transcoders can also be customized and overwritten on a per-operation basis, please see the appropriate documentation section for details.

// The JSON `Transcoders` use a `Serializer` underneath.
// While a transcoder can handle many different storage types, the serializer is specialized for JSON encoding and decoding.
// On all JSON-only APIs (i.e. Sub-doc, Query, Search,...) you'll only find a `Serializer`, not a `Transcoder`, in the operation options.
// Usually there is no need to override it unless you want to provide your own implementation (i.e. if you have your own POJO mapping json logic in place, and want to reuse it).
////

== Exception Handling

//- discuss new exception hierarchy in principle and how users should
//approach it when migrating
//- explain maybe new error handling strategies that are in place,
// around retry strategies especially and their behavior

How to _handle_ exceptions is unchanged from SDK API 2.
You should still use `try/catch` on the blocking APIs and the corresponding async methods on the other APIs.
There have been changes made in the following areas:

- Exception hierarchy and naming.
- Proactive retry where possible.

=== Exception Hierarchy

The exception hierarchy is now unified under a `CouchbaseException`.
// TODO: update after ErrorContexts exposed
//Each `CouchbaseException` has an associated `ErrorContext` which is populated with as much info as possible and then dumped alongside the stack trace if an error happens.

////
// Here is an example of the error context if a {sqlpp} query is performed with an invalid syntax (i.e. `select 1= from`):

// [source]
// ----
// Exception in thread "main" com.couchbase.client.core.error.ParsingFailedException: Parsing of the input failed {"completed":true,"coreId":1,"errors":[{"code":3000,"message":"syntax error - at from"}],"idempotent":false,"lastDispatchedFrom":"127.0.0.1:62253","lastDispatchedTo":"127.0.0.1:8093","requestId":3,"requestType":"QueryRequest","retried":11,"retryReasons":["ENDPOINT_TEMPORARILY_NOT_AVAILABLE","BUCKET_OPEN_IN_PROGRESS"],"service":{"operationId":"9111b961-e585-42f2-9cab-e1501da7a40b","statement":"select 1= from","type":"query"},"timeoutMs":75000,"timings":{"dispatchMicros":15599,"totalMicros":1641134}}
// ----

// The expectation is that the application catches the `CouchbaseException` and deals with it as an unexpected error
// (e.g. logging with subsequent bubbling up of the exception or failing).
// In addition to that, each method exposes exceptions that can be caught separately if needed.
// As an example, consider the javadoc for the `Collection.get` API:

// [source]
// ----
// ...
//    * @throws DocumentNotFoundException the given document id is not found in the collection.
//    * @throws TimeoutException if the operation times out before getting a result.
//    * @throws CouchbaseException for all other error reasons (acts as a base type and catch-all).
// ...
// ----

// These exceptions extend `CouchbaseException`, but both the `TimeoutException` and the `DocumentNotFoundException` can be caught individually if specific logic should be executed to handle them.
////

////
// === Proactive Retry

// One reason why the APIs do not expose a long list of exceptions is that the SDK now retries as many operations as it can if it can do so safely.
// This depends on the type of operation (idempotent or not), in which state of processing it is (already dispatched or not), and what the actual response code is if it arrived already.
// As a result, many transient cases -- such as locked documents, or temporary failure -- are now retried by default and should less often impact applications.
// It also means, when migrating to the new SDK API, you may observe a longer period of time until an error is returned by default.

// NOTE: Operations are retried by default as described above with the default `BestEffortRetryStrategy`.
// Like in SDK 2 you can configure fail-fast retry strategies to not retry certain or all operations.
// The `RetryStrategy` interface has been extended heavily in SDK 3 -- please see the xref:howtos:error-handling.adoc[error handling documentation].

// When migrating your SDK 2 exception handling code to SDK 3, make sure to wrap every call with a catch for `CouchbaseException` (or let it bubble up immediately).
// You can likely remove your user-level retry code for temporary failures, backpressure exception, and so on.
// One notable exception from this is the `CasMismatchException`, which is still thrown since it requires more app-level code to handle (most likely identical to SDK 2).
////

////
// === Logging and Events

//  - discuss any changes to the logging infrastructure or event system if made


// Configuring and consuming logs has not greatly changed.
// The SDK still uses _SLF4J_, if found on the classpath, and if not reverts back to the JDK logger (it can also be configured to log to `stderr` instead).
// The big difference is that the `EventBus` (also present in SDK 2) has been made much more powerful -- and all logs are sent as events through it.
// The `LoggingEventConsumer` being one of the potential consumers, and turning events into log lines.

// The biggest impact you'll see from it is that the log messages now look very structured and contain contextual information where possible.

// [source]
// ----
// 13:36:46 INFO  [com.couchbase.node:470] [com.couchbase.node][NodeConnectedEvent] Node connected {"coreId":1,"managerPort":"8091","remote":"127.0.0.1"}
// 13:36:46 INFO  [com.couchbase.core:470] [com.couchbase.core][BucketOpenedEvent][393161µs] Opened bucket "travel-sample" {"coreId":1}
// ----

// Notice the package path (which you can also filter on if needed), the event name, an optional time that it took to perform the operation, the message and surrounding context.
// This makes it easier to debug potential problems but also allows consuming all the events and feeding them in other monitoring systems without having to round-trip a file log.
// Please see xref:howtos:collecting-information-and-logging.adoc[the logging documentation] for further information.

// ===  Migrating Services

//  - one section for each service that goes in-depth on each command
//    and discusses old vs. new

// The following section discusses each service in detail and covers specific bits that have not been covered by the more generic sections above.
////

== Key Value

The Key/Value (KV) API is now located under the `Collection` interface, so even if you do not use collections, the `default_collection()` call needs to be opened in order to access it.

The following table describes the mappings from SDK API 2 KV to those of SDK API 3:

.KV Changes

In addition, the datastructure APIs have been renamed and moved:

|`Bucket.map_get`                 | `Collection.map_get`
|`Bucket.map_remove`              | `Collection.map_remove`

|`Bucket.queue_push`              | `Collection.queue_push`
|`Bucket.queue_pop`               | `Collection.queue_pop`
|====

There are two important API changes:

* On the request side, overloads have been reduced and moved under a `Options` block
* On the response side, the return types have been unified.

The signatures now look very similar.
////
// The concept of the `Document` as a type is gone in SDK API 3 and instead you need to pass in the properties explicitly.
// This makes it very clear what is returned, especially on the response side.
////
In SDK API 3, the `get` method returns a `GetResult`, and the `upsert` returns `MutationResult`.

Each of those results only contains the fields that the specific method can actually return, making it impossible to accidentally try to access the `expiry` on the `Result` after a mutation, for example.

Optional parameters are now accessible via `couchbase.options.OptionBlock` derivatives, or via named parameters (with the latter overriding
the former).

All required params are still part of the method signature, making it clear what is required and what is not (or has default values applied if not overridden).

The timeout can be overridden on every operation and now takes a `datetime.timedelta` object from the Python standard library.

[source,python]
----
include::example$migrating.py[tag=customtimeout,indent=0]
----

In SDK API 2, the `get_from_replica` method had a `ReplicaMode` argument which allowed to customize its behavior on how many replicas should be reached.
We have identified this as a potential source of confusion and as a result split it up in two methods that simplify usage significantly.
There is now a `get_all_replicas` method and a `get_any_replica` method.

* `get_all_replicas` asks the active node and all available replicas and returns the results as a stream.
* `get_any_replica` uses `get_all_replicas`, and returns the first result obtained.

Unless you want to build some kind of consensus bet(ween the different replica responses, we recommend `get_any_replica` for a fallback to a regular `get` when the active node times out.

////
// NOTE: Operations which cannot be performed on JSON documents have been moved to the `BinaryCollection`, accessible through `Collection.binary()`.
// These operations include `append`, `prepend`, `increment`, and `decrement` (previously called `counter` in SDK 2).
// These operations should only be used against non-json data.
// Similar functionality is available through `mutateIn` on JSON documents.
////

=== Query

{sqlpp} querying is now available at the `Cluster` level instead of the bucket level, because you can also write {sqlpp} queries that span multiple buckets. Compare a simple {sqlpp} query from SDK 2 with its SDK 3 equivalent:

// If you want to use prepared statements, the `adhoc()` method is still available on the `QueryOptions`, alongside every other option that used to be exposed on the SDK 2 Query options.

// Much of the non-row metadata has been moved into a specific `QueryMetaData` section:

// |====

==== Analytics

Analytics querying, like {sqlpp}, is also moved to the `Cluster` level: it is now accessible through the `Cluster.analytics_query` method.
As with the Query service, parameters for the Analytics queries have moved into the `AnalyticsOptions`:

////
// === Search

// The Search API has changed a bit in SDK 3 so that it aligns with the other query APIs.
// The type of queries have stayed the same, but all optional parameters moved into `SearchOptions`.
// Also, similar to the other query APIs, it is now available at the `Cluster` level.

// Here is a SDK 2 Search query with some options, and its SDK 3 equivalent:

// [source,python]

// ----
// # SDK 2 search query
// from couchbase_v2.cluster import Cluster, PasswordAuthenticator
// cluster=Cluster("couchbase://127.0.0.1","default","password")

// search_result = bucket.query(new SearchQuery(
//   "indexname",
//   SearchQuery.queryString("airports")).limit(5).fields("a", "b", "c"),
//   2,
//   TimeUnit.SECONDS

//   // ...
// }

// ----

// Error handling for streaming is handled differently.
// While fatal errors will still raise top-level exceptions, any errors that happend during streaming (for example if one node is down, and only partial results are returned) they will not terminate the result.
// The reasoning behind this is that usually with search results, having partial results is better than none.

// Here is a top level exception, for _the index does not exist_:

// === Views

// Views have stayed at the `Bucket` level, because it does not have the concept of collections and is scoped at the bucket level on the server as well.
// The API has stayed mostly the same, the most important change is that `staleness` is unified under the `ViewConsistency` enum.

== Management APIs

// - discusses how to migrate from each old management api to the new one
// - where it is found, what exceptions it throws, etc.


In SDK API 2, the management APIs were centralized in the `Admin` class at the cluster level and the `BucketManager` class at the bucket level.
Since SDK API 3 provides more management APIs, they have been split up in their respective domains.
So for example when in SDK API 2 you needed to remove a bucket you would call `Admin.bucket_remove` you will now find it under `BucketManager.drop_bucket`.
Also, creating a {sqlpp} index now lives in the `QueryIndexManager`, which is accessible through the `Cluster`.

The following table provides a mapping from the SDK API 2 management APIs to those of SDK API 3:

[#sdk4-specifics]
== SDK 4.x specifics

Python SDK 4.0 implements the SDK API 3 spec, so all the steps above also apply to a migration from a Python SDK 2.x directly to Python SDK 4.0.

Importantly, the Python SDK 4.0 has been substantially reworked to use a new backend (Couchbase++ instead of libcouchbase.)
Though the API surfaces are intended to be compatible, any code that relies on undocumented or uncommitted internal details is not guaranteed to work.
Key areas that have been reworked:

* The `couchbase_core` package has been removed.
The 4.0 SDK provides appropriate import paths within the `couchbase` package (or possibly the `acouchbase`/`txcouchbase` packages if using one of the async APIs) for anything that is needed with respect to the APIs provided by the SDK.
* As there is a new backend, the previous `_libcouchbase` c-extension has been removed
* Remnants of the 2.x API in previous Python 3.x SDK versions have been removed or deprecated
** Key items that have been *removed*:
*** The `ClassicAuthenticator` class
*** Key-value operations are no longer available with a `bucket` instance.
Use a `collection` instance for key-value operations.
*** A `cluster` and `bucket` instance do not inherit from the same base class
*** The `Client` class has been removed
*** `Items` API
*** `Admin` cluster
** Key items that have been *deprecated*:
*** Datastructure methods provided by the `collection` instance have been deprecated and replaced with their respective APIs (i.e. `CouchbaseList`, `CouchbaseMap`, `CouchbaseQueue` and `CouchbaseSet`)
*** `OperationResult` (deprecated, still available from `couchbase.result`)
*** `ValueResult` (deprecated, still available from `couchbase.result`)
* The 4.x version of the Python SDK significantly improves how the SDK handles the https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock[Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)]. As part of the improvements, the `lockmode` cluster option has been deprecated as it is a no-op (i.e. has no functionality) and will be removed in a future version of the SDK. Also, the `unlock_gil` option is no longer available.
** For details on how to use the 4.x SDK within the parallelism paradigms provided by the Python language see the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-python-client/couchbase_api/parallelism.html[parallelism] page in the API documentation.
* Import paths have been reorganized to follow consistent patterns.  While the import paths that existed in 3.x SDK are mostly available (see previous points on removal of `couchbase_core` package), some paths are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
** All authenticators should be imported from `couchbase.auth`
** All constants should be imported from `couchbase.constants`
** All options should be imported from `couchbase.options`
** All management options should be imported from `couchbase.management.options`
** All results should be imported from `couchbase.result`
** All exceptions should be imported from `couchbase.exceptions`
** Enumerations and Classes related to operations should be imported from that operation's path.  For example, `QueryScanConsistency` should be imported from `couchbase.n1ql` (i.e. `from couchbase.n1ql import QueryScanConsistency`)
* Changes to the async APIs (`acouchbase` and `txcouchbase`):
** While multi-operations (`get_multi`, `upsert_multi`, etc.) still exist for the `couchbase` API, they have been removed from the async APIs (`acouchbase` and `txcouchbase`) as each of the async APIs are built with libraries that have mechanisms to handle multi/bulk operations (`asyncio` has `asyncio.gather(...)` and `Twisted` has `DeferredList(...)`).
** If using the `txcouchbase` API, the reactor that should be installed is the `asyncioreactor`.  Therefore, the `txcouchbase` package _needs_ to be imported prior to importing the `reactor`.  See example import below.

The new backend enables the capabilities required for many upcoming features.
Key new features include:

* xref:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc[multi-document ACID transactions]

In addition:

* `get` requests on locked documents now retry rather than fast-fail.
* The changes to xref:howtos:managing-connections.adoc#connection-strings[Connection Strings] can be found documented in the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-python-client/couchbase_api/options.html#cluster[API reference].
* The xref:howtos:collecting-information-and-logging.adoc[Logging] changes are not fully documented.
