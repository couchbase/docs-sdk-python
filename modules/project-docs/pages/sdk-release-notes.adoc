{description}

Couchbase Python SDK 4.x is built upon {cbpp}, and SDK 3.x is built upon LCB (libcouchbase), but both conform to the xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#api-version[SDK API 3.x].
The move to {cbpp} facilitates the introduction of xref:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc[distributed ACID transactions].

NOTE: Because the Python SDK is written primarily in C using the CPython API, the official SDK will not work on PyPy.


== Installation

You may install previous versions of the SDK using pip (after installing the required xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[dependencies])

[source,console]
----
$ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client@VERSION
----

where VERSION is the version you wish to install. 
For example, to install version 3.2.6:

[source,console]
----
$ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client@3.2.6
----

For more detailed installation instructions, see the xref:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc[full installation guide].

// Don't think we really need this?

== Upgrading to 4.x

Python SDK 4.x automatically bundles Couchbase++ (downloading and building it if necessary).
Generally, there is no need to download and install it separately, and we recommend using the built-in Couchbase++.
There are binary Python wheels provided for Windows, and for Mac.
