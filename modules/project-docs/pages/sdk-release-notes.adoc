NOTE: Because the Python SDK is written primarily in C using the CPython API, the official SDK will not work on PyPy.


== Installation

You may install previous versions of the SDK using pip (after installing the required xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[dependencies])

[source,console]
----
$ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client@VERSION
----

where VERSION is the version you wish to install. For example, to
install version 2.5.4:

[source,console]
----
$ python3 -m pip install git+http://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client@2.5.4
----

include::hello-world:page$start-using-sdk.adoc[tag=install]


== Upgrading to 3.x

Python SDK 3.n automatically bundles libcouchbase (downloading and building it if necessary).
Generally, there is no need to download and install it separately, and we recommend using the built-in libcouchbase.
There are binary Python wheels provided for Windows.


== Version 3.2.1 (10 September 2021)

Specifically, the `domain_name` should be passed in as part of the operation's optional `Options` object (or overridden with the `domain_name` keyword argument) and the use of `namedtuple` for certain objects were removed to to bring the API in line with the original specification.

----

*API Docs:* https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-python-client-3.0.9/

=== Behavioral Change

This release deprecates a field on responses that show the expiration as a duration replacing it with an `expiryTime` which represents an instant point in time as a UNIX timestamp.
It also introduces warnings when the duration specfied is likely an incorrect use of the API.

=== Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/PYCBC-968[PYCBC-968]:
Refactored Document Expiry Duration.

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/PYCBC-999[PYCBC-999]:

The new `expiryTime` field is returning a float to represent the expiration, rather than a datetime.  
Discovered too late for 3.0.9, this will be fixed in the next release.

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/PYCBC-1037[PYCBC-1037]:
KV and Query latency are ~30% higher than SDK 2.x _with external libcouchbase installed_.
*Workaround*: Remove any externally-installed libcouchbase releases from the system; when run with the built-in libcouchbase, the higher latency is not observed.
